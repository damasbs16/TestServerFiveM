**ExM_Hunting**

A side activity for your extendedmode server where you can hunt animals and harvest their parts to sell. A knife is required to harvest animals but this can be changed in the config. The type of weapon you use will determine the quality of pelt/feathers you get from animals. Unarmed and Melee weapons for rare pelt, snipers, smgs, and pistols for good pelt other larger weapons for bad quality pelts. Explosions and such will totally damage the animal and make it useless, so will running them over with a vehicle.

**Installation**

Copy ExM_Hunting to your resources folder and add `ensure ExM_Hunting` to your server.cfg, then import the `exm_hunting.sql` to your database.

**Config**

There are a heap of config options, you can change the marker locations, sizes, colours, etc. You can change which animals can be hunted, the max amount of max given from animals, how much they sell for. Change the text shown in most places of the mod and a whole lot more. Just take a look at the config it's pretty self explanatory.

**Dependencies**

This requires [extendedmode](https://github.com/extendedmode/extendedmode) which is a community based esx fork, that is fully backward compatible and has new exclusive features.
